# FlexiPCB

## Overview
**FlexiPCB** is a versatile prototyping PCB designed for testing both SMD and through-hole components.  
It includes dedicated pads for common package types such as SOT-23, SOT-89-3, SOT-223, and double-side-pin variable ICs.  
The board also features 2x2mm square single-sided pads and through-hole pads, enabling easy experimentation with various component types.
